# Javascript Styleguide

## Rules
Don't forget. Rules are meant to be broken.

### Multiple Vars vs Single Var
tl;dr multiple vars for the win

- the vm inlines the vars so there is no difference in execution time
- hoisting is part of the language
- commenting is so much easier with multiple vars
- loosing track of a comma can cause vars to leak into the global space
- refactoring is simplier with multi vars

### Spaces for Readability
```
var someFunction = function () {};
```

### Coffeescript
tl;dr not a fan (actual reasons to follow...)

### 2 Spaced Tabs
This rule is not meant to be broken.
